/**
 * Creates a store wrapping a mutable `value`.
 * See the sibling `mutable` store for more docs.
 *
 * Unlike `mutable`, this implementation creates a new object wrapper value on every change.
 * This composes with code that expects immutable references on every store change,
 * but creates a bit of garbage that's sometimes avoidable,
 * and the cases where it's useful are probably pretty rare,
 * because the library's purpose is to mutate the store values,
 * which doesn't compose immutably either.
 * If you don't need to mutate the store value, prefer a normal `writable` store.
 *
 * @param value {any}
